nsamblr

nsamblr is a very simple and fast URL shortener.

It features a nifty and easy to manage administration interface (wip).

If you want to install it:

1) Create a new user in MySQL, then a new database, and grant all the privileges.
2) $ mysql -uuser -ppassword database < nsamblr.sql
3) Set the corresponding configuration values in config.php
4) Rename htaccess-sample to .htaccess, and make sure you set AllowOverride to
   'All' in your apache configuration file.

Enjoy :-)
